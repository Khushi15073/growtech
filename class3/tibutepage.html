        <h3 ><i>02 October 1869-	30 January 1948</i></h3></div>
    <p>Mahatma Gandhi (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi) was a visionary leader, freedom fighter, and social reformer born on <b><i>October 2, 1869,</i></b>in Porbandar, India. He is best known for leading India’s struggle for independence from British rule using the powerful principles of non-violence (ahimsa) and truth (satya).

        Gandhi's method of peaceful protest, called Satyagraha, became a global symbol of resistance against oppression. His movements such as the Salt <i><b> March (1930)</b></i>and Quit India Movement  <i><b>(1942)</b></i> mobilized millions and proved that change could be achieved without violence.
        
        He believed in simple living, self-reliance, and spiritual discipline, often wearing hand-spun khadi clothes and promoting the idea of Swadeshi (use of local goods).
        
        Gandhiji was tragically assassinated on <i><b>January 30, 1948,</b></i> but his legacy lives on. He remains a global icon for peace, human rights, and dignity.

        <p>In the First World War which took place between 1914 - 1919, Gandhiji gave full support to the British government on the condition that after this they would liberate India. But when the British did not do so, then Gandhiji started a number of movements to liberate the country. Some of these movements are as follows:</p>
